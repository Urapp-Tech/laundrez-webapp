                                    disclosing your personal information for any purpose. You may provide your consent to us either
                                    orally, electronically or in writing. The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is
                                    express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the
            reasonable expectations you might have in the circumstances.</p>

                                    to fulfill the purposes for which that personal information was collected and as permitted or
