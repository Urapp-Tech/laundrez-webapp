                                    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and
                                    you with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede
                                    all communications, representations or agreements, either
                                    oral or written, between us or our affiliates and you with
                                    respect to this subject matter. Notwithstanding the
                                    foregoing, if you and LaundrEZ agree to a written agreement
                                    and such agreement expressly overrides these Terms, the
                                    provisions of such agreement will prevail. If for any reason
                                    a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
                                    these Terms or portion thereof to be unenforceable, that
                                    provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent
                                    permissible so as to effect the intent of these Terms, and
                                    the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force
            and effect. <br /><br />
            No waiver of or consent to depart from the requirements of any provision of these Terms will be binding unless it is in writing and signed by LaundrEZ.  You and LaundrEZ are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise relationship is intended or created by these Terms.<br /><br />
            The provisions of these Terms will enure to the benefit of and be binding upon you and LaundrEZ and its respective successors and assigns, and, if you are contracting as an individual, your heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives.  You may not assign these Terms or your rights and obligations under these Terms without our express prior written consent, which may be withheld in our sole discretion.  We may assign these Terms and our respective rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent.
